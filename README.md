# Pixel-Perfect

## Description

This project is a coding challenge that involves building two full integrations using CSS. The challenge focuses on precision and accuracy in CSS development, aiming to replicate provided mockup images.

## Before You Start

- Read the criteria to understand the expectations for the challenge.
- Familiarize yourself with the tips and tools provided that might be helpful during the exercise.

## Instructions

1. Begin by choosing one interface to work on. If time permits, you can choose a second interface.
2. Create a standard HTML page based on the provided template. Replace [filename] in the template with the filename of the corresponding mockup image.
3. Create a standard style.css stylesheet and link it to the HTML page.
4. Use the relevant HTML and CSS code to make the end result look as similar as possible to the provided mockup images.
5. Commit and push your code per feature or part to keep track of your progress.

## Rules

- This is an individual challenge, so you cannot seek help from your fellow juniors.
- You are allowed to use documentation sites, search engines, stackoverflow.com, and any other resource that you would normally use. The internet is your friend.
- You may use SASS if it makes the job easier, but it will not give you extra points.
- Avoid using CSS frameworks or copying CSS code from frameworks.

## Interface Images

- The mockup images can be found in the folders `images/normal-res/simple` and `images/normal-res/complex`.
- For more detailed reference, higher-resolution images are available in the folders `images/hi-res/simple` and `images/hi-res/complex`. However, be cautious as dimensions may not be accurate in those images.
